# Welcome to My orders app ðŸ‘‹

This is an Orders project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## According to a situation we had earlier in the OCA 
_I found that we need a simple , easy to use and useful app for our daily food orders._

## Routine
_Everyday we go to one of our coworkers and we all order from his phone on some order apps , we prepare a paper and write all our orders with price and at all we split the delivery charge between us_

## The app 
_It does the same thing , the host opens an order list and users choose restaurant to order from , finally we had our order and the delivery charge been splitted automatically between us_

# Facebook was used to take 6 of the closest restaurants's menu 
_Been converted to JSON file and therefore it was added to the firebase to be ready.
